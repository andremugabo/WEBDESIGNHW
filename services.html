					<p> I can honestly say Brent Mendelson made my first home 
						buying experience a very pleasant one. From our 
						first conversation he explained each and every option 
						that was available to me and I never felt pressured into any decision.
						 My phone calls were handled in a professional and timely manner.
						  All in all I really couldn't imagine my home buying process being any easier. 
						  Even now that the deal is done I would still feel 100% 
						  comfortable calling Brent with any questions. 
						  He extended his expertise beyond the scope of the business 
						  deal and I look forward to contacting Brent for my next home purchase.
						 Thanks for everything Brent!!

				<div class="slide_inner_section3_1 hide">
					<p> My experience working with Brent was a pleasure.
						 He was completely upfront about the costs and whether the deal 
						 made sense financially. In fact, when I explained my situation,
						  he advised me not to refinance unless the current terms improved
						   even though it cost him business. When he later contacted me about
						    a better deal,
						 I jumped at it because he had earned my trust.

					<p> From the moment John called me I felt a sense of honesty.
						 I was nervous about working with someone based on past experiences,
						  but John was honest with me, informative, and he allowed me
						   to ask the most minute questions, and he answered them where 
						   I could understand. I trust what he tells me, and feel excited
						   about my future goals. I also had the pleasure of working with 
						   Sillo, she was very helpful, 
						 a very helpful and pleasant group of people.

					<p> Thank you so very much for all of your help in securing our 
						loan for our new home here in Fruitland. You were organized & 
						thorough & professional, as well as kind which made all 
						of the difference in our interactions with you. We put our
						 trust in you and you most definitely came through for us.
						  Thank you for your patience as well as treating us as 
						  people rather than just home loan customers. 
						You stand above the rest, John Burley! Our hats off to you!!
